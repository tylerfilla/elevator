This is a DLL that uses the [mock directories method](https://daniels-it-blog.blogspot.com/2020/07/uac-bypass-via-dll-hijacking-and-mock.html) to bypass the User Account Control (UAC) dialog on Windows and get admin rights noninteractively. The API is a single function that works similarly to `system(3)`.
